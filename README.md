**Hopenet** is an accurate and easy to use head pose estimation network. It uses the 300W-LP dataset for training the models and have been tested on real data with good qualitative performance.

The original repository of Hopenet is [GitHub](https://github.com/natanielruiz/deep-head-pose)
For details about the method and quantitative results please check their CVPR Workshop [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1710.00925).

Here I am trying to revisit this method and improve its performance, specifically for testing on AFLW2000 dataset.

## Better Training for Hopenet
